                  <img class="image" src="./Christina Headshot.jpg" alt="Headshot"> Born in the city of Round Rock, I studied at the University of Texas where I attained a B.S in Microbiology and a B.S in Medical Laboratory Science.
                  I completed my clinical rotations in the DFW area, where I got my first job as a ASCP-certified MLS at Parkland Memorial Hospital. After working
                  in the Chemistry department for about a year, I moved to Austin and began working nights as a generalist for Baylor Scott & White Medical Center in Pflugerville.
                  As a generalist I ran the entire laboratory alone at night, covering the chemistry, blood bank, urinalysis, immunology, body fluids, and hematology departments. Currently
                   I have started delving into web development as the next step in my career, with a future goal of entering the world of computer science as a software developer, where I hope
                   to do work relevant to both the technological and medical industries.
